âš› React Native library to display local notifications. A FREE alternative to [React Native NotiFEE](https://github.com/notifee/react-native-notifee).

## Why?

Nobody can remove the gratitude that the **React Native community** has towards [Invertase](https://github.com/invertase), for creating and maintaining, for so many years, the [React Native Firebase](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase) library. BUT, in my opinion, that does not give them the right to do what they did.

They deprecated and **REMOVED** the API to accessing local notifications from within **React Native Firebase 6**, and created a closed library called **Notifee**, forcing all projects that depends on **React Native Firebase** to purchase a **Notifee** license. For me, this is a lack of fair play. 

**React Native NotiFREE** recovers the Local Notification API from [React Native Firebase 5](https://github.com/douglasjunior/react-native-notifree/tree/react-native-firebase-5), allowing projects that use React Native Firebase to keep working without purchase extra licenses. 

## Requirements

- React Native >= 0.60
- iOS >= 9.0
- Android >= 21.0

## Roadmap

- [x] Local notifications API
- [ ] Update the docs
- [ ] Remove remnants of react-native-firebase 
- [ ] Fix index.d.ts
- [ ] Scheduled notifications

## Install

```bash
yarn add react-native-notifree
```
Or

npm i -S react-native-notifree
```

If you are using `React Native 0.60.+` go to the folder **your-project/ios** and run `pod install`, and you're done.
